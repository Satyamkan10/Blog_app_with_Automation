# Blog App with Shell Scripting & Vagrant

Hi 👋  
This project is a small DevOps-style setup where I created a **Blog Application** and automated its environment using **Shell Scripting** and **Vagrant**.

The main idea behind this project is to avoid manual server setup and make the application run the same way on every system using virtual machines.
